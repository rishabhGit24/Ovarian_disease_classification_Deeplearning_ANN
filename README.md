Ovarian Disease Classification Using Deep Learning (ANN)
This project focuses on using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify ovarian diseases based on medical images. The model is designed to identify and distinguish between different ovarian conditions, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

Model Architecture
Ovarian diseases, such as cysts and tumors, can have serious health implications if not diagnosed early. This project develops an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify medical images and assist in diagnosing ovarian diseases. The model processes image data and makes predictions on whether a condition is benign or malignant.

Installation-
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/rishabhGit24/Ovarian_disease_classification_Deeplearning_ANN.git
cd Ovarian_disease_classification_Deeplearning_ANN
Install the necessary dependencies:

Dataset:
The dataset for this project should consist of medical images related to ovarian diseases, such as ultrasounds or MRI scans. Due to the sensitivity of medical data, ensure that any dataset you use complies with privacy and ethical standards.

Each class corresponds to a disease category, such as "Benign Ovarian Condition" and "Malignant Ovarian Condition."

Model Architecture
The model leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify images based on the extracted features. The architecture includes fully connected layers that learn to classify the images into disease categories.
